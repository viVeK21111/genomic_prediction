1) hapmap snp

  -> it is used for genotype imputation and high resolutin gwas analysis
  -> A high-density rice variation map, which identifies one SNP per 20 bases on average, 
     offers the possibility to generate a high-density HapMap for the rice research community.
  -> The generated reference HapMap of rice has an average density of one SNP per 200 bp with a heterozygosity rate of
     1.75% (Figure 2E). Genome-wide distribution statistics showed that 58.34% of the hapmapSNPs are present in the
     intergenic regions, 12.52% in the intronic regions, 11.79% in the exonic regions, 0.02% on the splicing sites. Also, 10.55%
     and 6.78% hapmapSNPs are found to be located in the upstream and downstream regions

2) tag snp

  -> High SNP density is beneficial to precise mapping of trait related genes with GWAS analysis, but is not suitable for 
     population genetic analysis, because SNP redundancy may add unnecessary computational costs and introduce bias to the results
  -> redundancy in hapmap snp is eliminated.
  -> Since SNPs within the same LD region possess correlated genotypes forming one haplotype block, a representative SNP is usually 
     selected as a tag to solve the redundancy issue. We adopted an LD-based SNP pruning procedure to infer haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) 
     from the hapmapSNPs (Materials and methods). As a result, 156,502 tagSNPs were identified.

3) fixed snp

-> In the crop breeding industry, genotyping cost per sample is a top-priority factor, since hundreds to thousands of samples are
   often genotyped in a single day.
-> by compiling a highly effective marker panel containing only dozens to hundreds of SNPs that are available for high-throughput genotyping plat-
   forms, such as Douglas ArrayTape and LGC Omega-F equipment, using the KASP genotyping assay.
-> further compression of the tagSNP panel must consider not only the genetic relationship between subpopulations and accessions, but also the evolu-
   tionary and/or functional significance of SNPs with high diagnostic effectiveness and stability.
-> identified the selective sweep regions that are specific to each subpopulation or common to the six subpopulations by ranking within the top 5% of
   both Fst and hp ratios based on the comparison of the cultivated subpopulations against the wild rice population (Materi-als and methods)
-> Finally, a total of 1180 SNPs occurring within the genes in the selective sweep
   regions were selected to generate the fixedSNP panel.
 
4) barcode snp

-> DNA fingerprinting technology using a small set of SNPs to generate a series of genotype combinations, referred to as bar-
   codes, has become an economical means to protect commercialized varieties.
-> the barcodeSNP panel must be able to uniquely identify these barcodes to distinguish each of the rice varieties on the market.
-> we applied the MinimalMarker algorithm on the fixedSNP panel to exhaustively traverse all possible genotype combinations that would distin-
   guish the 2556 accessions (Materials and methods). The MinimalMarker algorithm generates three sets of minimum marker combinations, 
   in which each set contains 28 SNPs.After merging the three sets, 38 barcodeSNPs were finally selected to generate the panel
-> allows users to identify corresponding accessions or varieties when rice varieties are submitted for genotyping with any number of bar-
   codeSNPs ranging 8–38. The SR4R returns a list of the top 10 best-matched accessions/varieties in the database, and dis-
   plays associated information including the accession/variety IDs, number of mismatched bases, genomic position of the
   barcode, genotype heterozygosity, as well as documented subpopulation and origin.

5) barcode indel panel

  -> Indels are another form of genomic variations (usually <50 bp in length) that can be used as molecular markers for a variety of population analysis. 
     From the 5152 rice accessions, a total of 4,217,174 raw Indels variations were identified using the IC4R variation calling pipeline
  -> filtering low-quality Indels, 109,898 high-confidence Indels were retained with missing rate <0.01 and MAF 0.05 within the 2556 rice accessions.
     Among the 109,898 high-confidence Indels, we further identified 62 subpopulation-specific Indels, which can be used as barcodeIndels to 
     differentiate the six rice subpopulations TeJ, TrJ, Aro, Aus, Ind, and Oru, and the six subgroups of Ind rice S1–S6 (Table S2).
